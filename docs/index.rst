SIMOC-ABM: Agent-Based Modeling for Ecosystems
==============================================

SIMOC-ABM is a Python package for agent-based modeling of ecosystems. It is
designed to be used as a component of the SIMOC simulation platform, but can
also be used independently to simulate arbitrary agent-based models.

SIMOC - the Scalable, Interactive Model of an Off-world Community - is a 
simulation platform for modeling the interactions of a human population with
its environment in a closed habitat, such as Mars or the Moon. SIMOC-ABM is the
agent-based model (ABM) component of SIMOC, but can also be used as a 
stand-alone model.
